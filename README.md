### Code Description:
Created by t.me/DeviousCryptoLickz

This Python script is designed to derive Ethereum addresses from mnemonic phrases and check their balances across specific blockchain networks (chains) using their RPC endpoints. It operates asynchronously, allowing it to efficiently handle multiple network requests in parallel. The script performs the following main functions:

### Key Functions:

1. **`load_mnemonics(file_path)`**:
   - This function reads mnemonic phrases from a file (`seeds.txt`) and returns them as a list. Each mnemonic is used to generate an Ethereum address.

2. **`mnemonic_to_eth_address(mnemonic)`**:
   - This function takes a mnemonic phrase and uses the `eth_account` library to derive an Ethereum address from it. The function converts a mnemonic into a corresponding Ethereum account and extracts the address.

3. **`load_chain_data(chain_file)`**:
   - This function loads blockchain network (chain) information from a `chain.json` file. The file contains details about each chain, including its `ChainID` and RPC endpoints for querying balances.

4. **`filter_chains_by_chain_id(chains, chain_ids)`**:
   - This function filters the chains from the `chain.json` file based on a list of `ChainID` values specified in the script (`CHAIN_IDS_TO_CHECK`). It ensures that only chains with matching `ChainID`s are queried for balances.
   - Example chains that are filtered for balance checks include:
     - **Ethereum Mainnet (ChainID: 1)**
     - **Binance Smart Chain (ChainID: 56)**
     - **Polygon (ChainID: 137)**
     - **Fantom (ChainID: 250)**
     - **Arbitrum (ChainID: 42161)**

5. **`fetch_balance(session, rpc, address)`**:
   - This asynchronous function sends an RPC request to a blockchainâ€™s node (via its RPC endpoint) to retrieve the balance of the specified Ethereum address. It returns the balance in Wei (the smallest unit of Ether) if the request is successful.

6. **`check_balance(session, address, network)`**:
   - This function checks the balance of an Ethereum address across all RPC endpoints provided for a specific chain. It queries each available RPC and aggregates the balance results.

7. **`save_results(address, mnemonic, balance, chain_name)`**:
   - This function saves the results of each balance check to a `results.txt` file. If a balance greater than 0 is found, it logs the result to `good.txt`, and if no balance is found, it logs to `empty.txt`. The saved format includes the mnemonic, the Ethereum address, the chain name, and the balance.

8. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the script processes each mnemonic phrase by:
     - Deriving the corresponding Ethereum address.
     - Checking its balance on filtered chains (only those with specified `ChainID` values).
     - Checking the first 10 chains initially and, if a balance is found, continuing to check the rest of the chains.
     - Logging the results in the appropriate files (`results.txt`, `good.txt`, and `empty.txt`).

### Example Chains Processed:
The script checks balances on a variety of chains, including but not limited to:
- **Ethereum Mainnet (ChainID: 1)**
- **Optimism (ChainID: 10)**
- **Binance Smart Chain (ChainID: 56)**
- **Polygon (ChainID: 137)**
- **Fantom (ChainID: 250)**
- **xDAI (ChainID: 100)**
- **Moonbeam (ChainID: 128)**

These chains are filtered and matched by their `ChainID`, ensuring that the script only queries the specified chains.

### Conclusion:

The script provides an efficient way to check Ethereum addresses derived from mnemonic phrases for balances across multiple blockchain networks. It focuses on specific chains by filtering them based on their `ChainID`, checking the first 10 chains for balances, and continuing to check more if a positive balance is found. It logs all results in organized output files, making it a practical tool for monitoring addresses across different blockchain ecosystems.
